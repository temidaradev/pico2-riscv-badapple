# 03: SSD1306 and I2C Internals

The SSD1306 is a 128x64 monochromatic OLED display. Communicating with it from the RP2350 requires understanding I2C and memory mapping.

## The I2C Bus
I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) uses two wires:
- **SDA** (Serial Data)
- **SCL** (Serial Clock)

In `main.rs`, we initialize it with:
```rust
let i2c = hal::I2C::i2c0(pac.I2C0, sda, scl, 1000.kHz(), ...);
```
Standard I2C is 100kHz or 400kHz. We "overclock" it to **1MHz** to ensure we can push frames fast enough for 30 FPS video.

## Memory Mapping (SSD1306)
The display has its own internal 1KB RAM. However, it's not mapped like a normal screen:
- It is divided into **8 Pages**.
- Each Page is 1 pixel high but **8 bits deep** (vertical bytes).
- Our project uses `ssd1306::BufferedGraphicsMode`, which handles this conversion for us.

## The Graphics Pipeline
1. **Decoder**: Decodes RLE into a 1024-byte buffer (linear pixels).
2. **ImageRaw**: Wraps that buffer into an `embedded-graphics` format.
3. **`display.draw()`**: Bit-twiddles the linear pixels into the SSD1306's "vertical page" format.
4. **`display.flush()`**: Sends the entire 1KB buffer over I2C to the screen.

## Efficiency Tip
The `flush()` operation is the slowest part. By increasing the I2C clock to 1MHz, we reduce the time it takes to "flush" from ~30ms to ~10ms, leaving more CPU time for the next frame's decoding.
